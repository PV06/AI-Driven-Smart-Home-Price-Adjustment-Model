# AI-Driven Smart Home Price Adjustment Model

This project leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict and dynamically adjust home prices based on multiple real-world factors like location, market demand, and property features. The goal is to create a smart, data-driven approach for home valuation that adapts to changing economic and market conditions.
